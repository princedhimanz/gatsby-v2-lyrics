Basanti No Dance Lyrics  
No no no..  
Basanti no dance no no no  
In front of these dogs no no no x (2)  
Hey  
Holi hai bhai holi hai  
Sabki holi holi hai  
Teri holi, meri holi  
Sabki holi happy hai  
Hey Rnglish kidhar hai  
English!  
Holi English  
Happy bhi English yaar  
Me kahenga English mein taako  
Taake nahi sasura  
Dil Bihari speaking bhaasha  
Jaane naahi doosra  
He told me, you told him  
I told you no tell her  
I told her no tell you  
So tell me to tell you  
She told him to tell her  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Ye le teri English!  
Ye gazab duniya ka funda  
Fikar me not chinta  
Ghalat English bhale hi  
We will gaadenge jhanda  
They throwing inta  
We throwing rocks  
They phenking inta  
You throwing rocks  
Basanti no dance  
In front of these dogs no no no x (4)  
No no no
