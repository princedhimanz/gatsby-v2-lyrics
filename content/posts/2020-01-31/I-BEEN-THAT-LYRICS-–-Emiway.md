I Been That Lyrics  
My name is Dax!  
Raady!  
I crossed seas to the check the temperature  
Found myself in India  
Hollywood to Bollywood with bars from nigeria  
Paused!  
Inspected the criteria  
Realized foreign ties are great  
If not more superior  
I been that  
F**k that $hit Dax is going global  
I eint neva been the type to say  
I told you but I told you  
Ya I told you  
That I would graduate from local and  
Evolve into CEO millionaire mogul  
Took time, crossed T’s dottedi’s realized  
Real eyes recognized real guys  
Stopped wasting time  
Took a flight overseas got to work and  
Started building foreign ties  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Yeah nigga I been that  
Studios at best I wasn’t first inside my class  
But I was first to get ahead  
Told my teacher I was dropping out of math cuz  
I didn’t need a dumb equation just to teach me  
How to calculate success  
Algebraically though I been a factor  
Multiplied my capacity from slave into master  
Multiplied my capacity from poet into rapper  
Stopped asking niggas questions  
Started giving niggas answers  
That’s the truth, this is calculated murder  
When I step inside the booth  
Premeditated murder how I’m serving niggas truth  
This is elevated thinking  
How I educated the youth  
Tell a nigga read a book  
Instead of sitting in a school  
Yeah I been that  
The prerequisite, adjective  
Synonym, verb predicate, bacholarte  
Had to talk to god 10 times  
Before I mastered it, liscesned it  
Trademarked f**ked around and pattened it  
I been that  
Aah yeah nigga I been that  
Swear to god on gawd Mufuka  
Yeah yeah you know I been that  
Yeah nigga I been that  
Nai maloom hai to sunn!  
Haan main wahin tha  
Jab views mere 2 the  
Haan main wahin tha  
Sunane wale 100 the  
Haan main wahin tha jab logon ne kaha  
Ki teri boli nai chalegi  
Lekin aaj dekho jaam huye  
Wooh..  
Aye chhote dhyan de re flow pe  
Apne gaane pe naache bollywood ke pote  
Maje lele lala aaja mere show pe  
Kill karun beat pe jab milte mujhe mauke  
Mere gaane mere aansu ko pochhe  
Underground yahan tak pahunchega  
Kya kabhi tum soche?  
Independent scene baat kam shot zyada  
Door karne aaya hoon main drame aur loche  
Yeh rapper atkele hain beech mein hi  
Inka organic reach nahi  
Ha ha ha ha  
Agar aide chale karega  
Kahin pe mere baare mein to  
Tere ko milega mere jaisa koyi neech nahi  
Out of reach pe haan beach pe hoon main  
Upar wale ke diye umar ki lease pe hoon main  
Chhakke maarne ke liye khadela crease pe hoon main  
Daud lagane ke liye taiyar knees pe hu main  
Increase pe hoon main  
Decrease pe hai tu  
Khud ko kaam dena janta hoon please bolun kyun  
Kisi ko bhi kissie wissie le raha  
Maze mein hoon buzy buzy  
Pehle easy nahi tha kuchh bhi lekin take it easy  
Kisi kisi se suna ke aise nahi chalega kaam tera  
Zippy sabke munh pe zip lagaya kaam mera  
Recipe jaan’na chaahte hain  
Pehle come and mess with me  
Inke gaane lagte jaise bol raha ho  
Mr Bean go rest in peace  
Kyun karun main jo tu kare main karun  
Woh jo na kare tere saare pantar  
Tera to chhod mera game change marunga hunter  
Jaunga bankar hero  
Beero pe chhupa ke rakha hai tere ko  
Therapy milegi gaana sunega to  
Inhein nahi pata kitna saara mehnat lagta hai  
Beta ek gaana banane ko  
Item ko nahi aata khaana banane ko  
Rapper ko nahi aata gaana banane ko  
Main bhi ek rapper hoon sun’na chahte  
Pareshaniyan meri to jaane do  
I been that  
Aah yeah nigga I been that  
Swear to god on gawd Mufuka  
Yeah yeah you know I been that  
Yeah nigga I been that  
Its Dax!  
Nahi maloom hai to sunn!
