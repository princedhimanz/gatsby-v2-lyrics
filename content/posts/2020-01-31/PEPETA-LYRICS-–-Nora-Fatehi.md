Pepeta Lyrics  
Noriana!  
Ray Vanny!  
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
Bad girl you can be my baby mama  
I wanna take you place we can chill for the summer  
Your body language tropicana  
Private jet we can fly to Bahamas  
Flat tummy chains on your waist hayaa  
You better than my ex  
I got the room party you can be my guest, hayaa  
I wanna feel that taste  
Sakata, know you like it when I whine it  
Sakata, you wanna pull up right behind it  
Sakata, feel the wave come and ride it  
Sakata, but don’t get to close  
Sakata, I’m killer baby no lie  
Sakata, you know I can change ur whole life  
Sakata, keep it burn it like a wildfire  
Sakata, don’t get too close  
I can tell u want love  
Say u only want a top gyal  
Aint no body whine like me  
But my love aint free  
Been there, hit hit  
Don’t stop, bring it, bring it  
Body on lock, feel it, feel it  
Hips tik tok, get it, get it  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Queen that’s me  
No time for them basic bs  
Yeah, that gin got me lit  
I put my hands on my hips  
When I’m done  
You are gonna miss me yeah  
What u want  
Baby I’ll be your  
Number one  
Nothing can beat me  
I’m in charge  
Listen to me yeah, me yeah  
Pepeta, oh pepeta  
Shuka chini pepeta, oh pepeta  
Pepeta, oh pepeta  
Katika pepeta, oh pepeta  
Pepeta, oh pepeta  
Shuka chini pepeta, oh pepeta  
Pepeta, oh pepeta  
Katika pepeta, oh pepeta  
Sakata, know you like it when I whine it  
Sakata, you wanna pull up right behind it  
Sakata, feel the wave come and ride it  
Sakata, but don’t get to close  
Sakata, I’m killer baby no lie  
Sakata, you know I can change ur whole life  
Sakata, keep it burn it like a wildfire  
Sakata, don’t get too close  
Kama tunda  
Naitaka  
Ntailamba hiyo  
Ntainga’ata  
Kama rhumba  
Nasakata  
Namutoto hiyo napata  
Coz I got what you want and  
You know its hot just like fire  
If the heat in this room is not from me and you  
Take me higher  
Coz baby dont you know  
I got that rapa pum pum pum pum  
Pick it up now from the floor  
Let me show you my way make room  
Pepeta, oh pepeta  
Shuka chini pepeta, oh pepeta  
Pepeta, oh pepeta  
Katika pepeta, oh pepeta  
Pepeta, oh pepeta  
Shuka chini pepeta, oh pepeta  
Pepeta, oh pepeta  
Katika pepeta, oh pepeta
