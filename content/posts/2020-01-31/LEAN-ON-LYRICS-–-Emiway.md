Lean On Lyrics  
Know you got pain  
Deal with it in your own  
You will go insane  
I wanna help move the load  
Oh out your way  
But I can’t make you  
You’ve gotta want to  
So if you ever feel the need to  
You can call me on a late ni-night  
You can take your time  
You can always count on me  
If ever you don’t feel alright  
You can’t see the light  
I’ll be that somebody lean on me  
Know I’ll be there to lean on me  
I’ll be that somebody lean on me  
Tere alawa I need nobody  
Let’s take a walk and leave the gaadi  
Skrrrrrt  
Tu hi party meri after party  
Gonna lean on you, coz I need somebody  
Bae aye!  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Life change hua jab se  
Tu aayi lady mere range me  
Dil mein to pehle se basi thi  
Ab damage diya toone mere brain pe  
Qashti ko intezaar hai kinare ka  
Pyar karein kyon sochen hum  
Yeh zalim zamane ka  
Public ko rehta intezaar  
Har maheene mere gaane ka  
Aur mere ko intezaar tha  
Yahan tere sahare ka  
You can call me on a late night night  
You can take your time  
You can always count on me  
If ever you don’t feel alright  
You can’t see the light  
I’ll be that somebody lean on me  
Know I’ll be there to lean on me  
I’ll be that somebody lean on me  
No more bad days  
Now I got my fan base  
You’re the one who made me  
Smile on my sad days  
Imma lean on you  
Yeah imma lean on you  
Doesn’t matter wherever I wanna be  
All you gotta do is lean on me  
When it gets too much just shout for me  
Shout for me yeah!  
You can call me on a late night night  
You can take your time  
You can always count on me  
If ever you don’t feel alright  
You can’t see the light  
I’ll be that somebody lean on me  
Know I’ll be there to lean on me  
I’ll be that somebody  
You can call me on a late night night  
You can take your time  
You can always count on me  
If ever you don’t feel alright  
You can’t see the light  
I’ll be that somebody lean on me  
Know I’ll be there to lean on me  
I’ll be that somebody lean on me  
Bohat hard!
