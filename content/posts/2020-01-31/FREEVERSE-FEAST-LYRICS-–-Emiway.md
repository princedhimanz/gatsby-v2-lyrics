Freeverse Feast Lyrics
I eat rappers
‘coz I am a motherf*** beef rapper
Teach rappers how to rap
After that you can sleep rappers x (2)
They gonna be callin’ me copy Of Eminem
That’s ok
They gonna be sayin’ my accent is weak Bi*ch
That’s ok
They gonna be hatin’ but keep waitin’ for ma track
That’s ok
But I’m a motherf*** rapper bi*ch I am not ok
So stop telling me
Do this do, that that
I don’t know you who?
You go there
So you you you you you you you
Everybody motherf*** prove this now
Now I’m representing India no
One is doing it right now
Doing this for country still
They wanna fight let’s fight now






Representing India which
On straight outta hill x (3)
Antophill antophill
Give me the beat I’m gonna kill
I’m gonna kill, I’m gonna chill
I’m gonna do what I just feel
You people busy complaining
I’m payin’ expensive bill
If u think that I’m stupid
Bi*ch better go and check you skill
All these druggies sayin’
They are rappers go
And pop your pills
Wait!
Lemme take my flow fast
Right now I’m doing
Slow fast so that I can take long breath
Pick it up
I’m gonna throw that
I’ve started walking ahead
For me there is a no back
It’s time to change the flow
You can’t do it it is so bad
These rappers busy choosing their topics
I’m writing comics
I think you people havin’ a fever go got get a tonic
My fans got all my symptoms
Emiway disease is chronic
Yeah I’m a Eminem fan
I’m going super sonic
Some are gonna face the money
Some are gonna get the money
Some are gonna write song
Bi*ch money Lamborghini
If you gonna keepin’ on
Waiting for your time
Teri maa ka saaki naaka
Jo bhi tere peechhe bhaga
Usse maine bola phat phat rukne ko
Phat phat rukne ko
Khuda ke alawa kaun bola tere ko
Kisi ke saamne jhukne ko
Lekin maine tera bhai
Bahot kuchh kehta hai
Sehta hai itna kuchh isliye to kehta hai
Pa ni sa sa re ga ma pa ni sa
Bivi banegi to rakhunga rani sa
Hadh kare paar zindagi ko
Woh gham teri baat dil se bolunga
Dhat teri maa
Lekin gaali nahi deta mere gaane mein
Sun meri baat tujhe bhool chuka hoon main
Sun meri baat tujhe mil chuka hoon main
Sun meri baat nahi karna hai yaad
Nahi bolna hai kuchh tere baare mein
Haan!
Sabke begaahe bolte
Padhne ko padhayi bolte
Dene wale gaali bahot hai
Lekin mere bhai bahot hai
Gaane mein safai bahot hai
Zindagi ki seedhiyon chadhne mein
Chadhayi bohat hai kya? x (2)
No representing India which
On straight outta hill
I’m representing India which
On straight outta hill
I’m representing India which
On straight outta hill x (2)
Mumbai 400037
37 kya?
Emiway Bantai maloom hai na
Peace!
